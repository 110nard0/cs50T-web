# CS50T Web Dev 

This is a fully responsive website with multiple pages built for the CS50 Technology Web Development class.
I went overboard (of course) and used the opportunity to learn **Bulma**, the open-source CSS framework.
I found the class system here quite easy to grok.

## Features
- All images and columns are fully responsive.
- All pages are linked within a tabs class persistently found at the bottom of the screen.
- A navbar button that redirects to the home page, and other links to outside docs.

### Notes
_It was fun to experiment with a static site containing multiple webpages for the first time._  


_Learning a new css framework was an added bonus too!_
